# Graph-Project
School project- Shortest path

The algorithm finds the shortest way to escape from a burning high-rise building using a modified A* + PRM algorithm.
Allows you to run agaisnt other algorithms, such Dijkstra and Dijkstra + PRM and shows the difference.

```python
    print("Average Time per one floor:")
    calculate_average_time(amount_of_plots, "Floors")
    print("Average Time per one Building:")
    calculate_average_time(AMOUNT_OF_GRAPHS, 'Buildings')
    calculate_average_time(1, 'All buildings')
    exit(0)
```
